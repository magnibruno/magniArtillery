Follow the steps in a terminal

# Install artillery:
npm install -g artillery@latest

# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/magnibruno/magniArtillery.git

#Open the main folder MagniArtillery

- run "npm install"

# Open the folder frontendTests/learning/leadTest

# Run the command "artillery run loadTest.yml" in the terminal

- The current test will target perf.magnilearn.com environment.

- You can check that the test is running by some screenshots saved on the frontendTests/learning/leadTest folder. Also l_lh table should be populated with exercises data.

- I'm still working to understand errors, not all users achieve the exercise page for now.

- This load test uses the same mechanism we use with flood IO. Before each run, set the inUse flag in the table qa_load_test_users to 0. This will make the load test reuse users.
